## About Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

In a Redux application, the state of the entire application is stored in a single object called the "store". Actions are used to modify the state of the store, and reducers are used to specify how the state should be updated in response to an action.

## Dependencies
react
react-dom
redux
react-redux
axios tailwindcss

## Execution
This will launch the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000/.
```bash
npm start
```
